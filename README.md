## 🎯 Project Objective

ServiceHub is a full-stack web application designed to connect students on campus who need services with students who can provide them. The platform enables students to:

- **Browse and search** for student-provided services across multiple categories
- **Filter services** by category, school location, and price range
- **Create listings** to offer their own skills and services
- **Leave reviews** and ratings for completed services
- **Manage their listings** through a personalized profile dashboard

The goal is to create a trusted, student-only marketplace that makes it easy to find help with tutoring, moving, tech support, photography, and more - all within the campus community.

```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

cp .env.example .env

# Update .env with your configuration:
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/servicehub
# SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
# PORT=5001

# Seed the database with sample data
node seed/index.js

# Start the backend server
npm start
```

Backend will run on `http://localhost:5001`

### 3. Frontend Setup

Open a **new terminal window:**
```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file (optional for local dev)
echo "REACT_APP_API_URL=" > .env

# Start the React development server
npm start
```

Frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`

### 4. Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 5. Test Accounts (After Seeding)
